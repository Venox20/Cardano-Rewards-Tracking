# Cardano-Rewards-Tracking

Rewards_Logging.py will log the epoch number, date, price and stake.addr balance, into rewards.json.

Fill in the stakeAdd variable.

I will be adding a separate program to create reports so you can monitor your tax burden through the year.
This will include the functionality to export a CSV file to use with CoinTracking.info
